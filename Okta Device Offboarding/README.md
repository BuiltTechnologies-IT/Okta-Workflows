## Summary
Okta treats devices and users as isolated objects, creating problems with deativated user identities remaining tied to active devices in Okta. As a best pratice, we deactivate and delete user devices during our offboarding process. These flows can be used to pull a list of devices associated with a user, ensure there are no active user identities using those devices, then deactivate and delete the devices from Okta.

## What's in the Box?
This folder contains three flos:
1. `Device Offboarding Search`
- This is the primary flo that handles all actions of a traditional SCIM connector in a single flo. It uses if/else/if logic to track triggers from upstream flos and take a corresponding action.
2. `Okta Device Removal`
- This is a helper flow that cleans up any left over group assignments in Okta when the user is removed from the application assignment group (app_adobe_users).
3. `Delete Okta Device`
- This is a helper flow that cleans up any left over group assignments in Okta when the user is removed from the application assignment group (app_adobe_users).

## Setup
To use this flo, you will need to establish the following flos as triggers:

- `Trigger` - User deativated (Okta)

> :bulb: **Tip:** Reminder that you must have a `VIP` Account with Adobe to access the Adobe User Management API
