## Summary
Given that Adobe does not offer a SCIM API, we decided that we would build a workflow to mimic the behaviors of a SCIM API using a variety of Okta Triggers and the Adobe User Management API. While Okta does provide a pre-built connector for the Adobe User Management API, many may find it challenging to build reliable triggers that mimmic that of the SCIM standard.

## What's in the Box?
This folder contains two flos:
1. `Adobe - Create/Update/Manage User`
- This is the primary flow that handles all actions of a traditional SCIM connector in a single flow. It uses if/else/if logic to track triggers from upstream flos and take a corresponding action.
2. `Adobe - Remove from Groups`
- This is a helper flow that cleans up any left over group assignments in Okta when the user is removed from the application assignment group (app_adobe_users).

## Setup
To use this flow, you will need to establish the following flos as triggers:

- `Trigger` - User removed from group (Okta)
- `Trigger` - User added to a group (Okta)
- `Trigger` - User profile updated (Okta)

> :bulb: **Tip:** Reminder that you must have a `VIP` Account with Adobe to access the Adobe User Management API

Also, you can follow Okta's [docs](https://built.workflows.okta.com/app/help/wf/en-us/Content/topics/workflows/connector-reference/adobeusermanagement/overview/authorization.htm) for setting up the Adobe User Management API.
